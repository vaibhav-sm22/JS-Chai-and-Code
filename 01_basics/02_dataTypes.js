"use strict";// treat all JS code as newer version

//alert(3+3) alert only works in browser and not in NodeJS

//console.log("Hello World"); console.log("Vaibhav"); would work but not a good practice to code
/*console.log("Hello World");
console.log("Vaibhav"); This is a good practice as we should write different code in different
line to make js more readable*/

//Code should be readable

//preferred documentation is mdn firefox and tc39.es is official documentation

let name = "vaibhav"
let age = 19
let isLoggedIn = false

// number => 2 to the power 53
 // bigint is used in stock market
 // string '' "" prefer double quotes
 // boolean => true/false
 // null => standalone value, intentially assigned value
 // undefined => when value is not assigned to a variable
 // symbol => unique

 // object

 // typeof null is object and typeof undefined is undefined(why do we use null or undefined)

 console.log(typeof undefined);
